# Computing-GC-Content
# Problem
The GC-content of a DNA string is given by the percentage of symbols in the string that are 'C' or 'G'. For example, the GC-content of "AGCTATAG" is 37.5%. Note that the reverse complement of any DNA string has the same GC-content.

DNA strings must be labeled when they are consolidated into a database. A commonly used method of string labeling is called # FASTA format. In this format, the string is introduced by a line that begins with '>', followed by some labeling information. Subsequent lines contain the string itself; the first line to begin with '>' indicates the label of the next string.
In Rosalind's implementation, a string in FASTA format will be labeled by the ID "Rosalind_xxxx", where "xxxx" denotes a four-digit code between 0000 and 9999.

# Explanation 

The Very important point to remember is whenever you read a string from text file, it will read it line by line and eventually at the end of every string you will extra character "\n" and this maybe cause for your wrong results.
Here are Step to calculate correctly

  1. Read all Strings into a list
  2. Count ID length
  3. Concatenate Characters of one String
  4. Compute GC Content
